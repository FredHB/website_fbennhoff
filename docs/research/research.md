-   **Not-So-Cleaning Recessions** <br>
    Igli Bajo, Frederik H. Bennhoff, Alessandro Ferrari <br>
    <small>*draft in preparation* </small><br>

    ???+ Summary
        <div> Recessions are periods in which the least productive firms in the economy exit, and as the economy recovers, they are replaced by new and more productive entrants. These *cleansing effects* imply that business cycles generate improvements in the average firm productivity. We argue that this is not sufficient to induce long-run gains in GDP and welfare. We show that these are driven by the intensity of *love-for-variety* in aggregate production. It turns out that CES is the only HSA aggregator for which TFP are always the same before and after the crisis. Assuming that the household has CES preferences, recessions do not bring about any improvement in GDP and TFP. If the economy features an additional, positive *love-for-variety* externality, the social planner finds it optimal to subsidize economic activity in recessions to avoid firm exit. In an empirical exercise, we find that this is externality is indeed present. We plug out estimates into a quantitative model. We find that optimal policy can improve steady state output by 65%, and that a policy maker would have found it optimal to subsidize fixed cost heavily during the great financial crisis. </div>

-   **The Competition Channel of Skewness** <br>
    Frederik H. Bennhoff, Timo Haber, Niklas Schmitz <br>
    <small>*draft in preparation* </small>

    ???+ Summary
        <div> Firm growth rates in times of crisis take are strongly negatively skewed (left-skewed), cf. Salgado et al (2019). Examining the Compustat universe of firms, we find that this pro-cyclical left-skew is concentrated on very largest companies in the market. Smaller firms exhibit much less skewness in growth rates when hit by adverse shocks. Furthermore, using a factor decomposition, we show that not the shocks themselves, but rather the reactions of firms to shocks exhibit skewness. We rationalize these observation in a simple framework of a profit maximizing firm. A version of Marshall's second law of demand implies that price setting firms react to shocks with left-skewed output growth rates, while price taking firms respond symmetrically. Furthermore, left-skewness is increasing in the degree of market power and in the standard deviation of the shock. In light of our model, left-skewed downside risk is not a consequence of scary disaster shocks, but the result of monopolization and market power. </div>

-   **Capital Gains Taxation in Life and Death** <br>
    Frederik H. Bennhoff, Florian Scheuer <br>
    <small>*work in progress* </small> <br>
    <small>*Conferences: Taxing Billionaires (2025) @ Paris School of Economics (F. Bennhoff)*</small>

    ???+ Summary
        <div> End-of-life provisions determine the tax base of capital gains, when assets are bequeathed. Up until today, there existed no quantitative model to simulate the effects of changing end-of-life provisions, which jointly takes into account the reactions of households at two margins: (1) composition of the asset portfolio and (2) total size of the bequeathed estate. We build a novel, unifying framework in which one can simulate the consequences of different end-of-life provisions, bequest taxes and other income taxes simultaneously, thereby surpassing the current state-of-the-art at several margins. We do so by recasting the definition of asset portfolios, which makes the household problem theoretically and quantitatively tractable. </div>

-   **The dynastic benefits of early-childhood education: participant benefits and family spillovers** <br>
    Frederik H. Bennhoff, Jorge L. Garcia, Duncan Ermini Leaf <br>
    *Journal of Human Capital 18 (1), 44-73* <br>

    ???+ Summary
        <div> We demonstrate the social efficiency of investing in high-quality early-childhood education using newly collected data from the HighScope Perry Preschool Project. The data analyzed are the longest follow-up of any randomized early-childhood education program. Annual observations of participant outcomes up to midlife allow us to provide a cost-benefit analysis without relying on forecasts. Adult outcomes on the participantsâ€™ children and siblings allow us to quantify spillover benefits. The program generates a benefit-cost ratio of 6.0 (*p-value .03*). Spillover benefits increase this ratio to 7.5 (*p-value = 0.00*). </div>
